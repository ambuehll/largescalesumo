I am a Traffic Engineering PhD student @ETH Zurich and visiting scholar @UCBerkeley currently implementing large-scale traffic simulations for 6 metropolitan areas, Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, Lisbon, Bogota, Los Angeles, and Rio de Janeiro. 
The networks are based on OSM data and adapted for the use in a large-scale traffic simulation. 

All networks, demand data, and code will be published here and are available for academic use. 

The following gifs depict the traffic congestion evolution during a typical day in multiple large cities. Simulations were performed using the mesoscopic traffic simulation module of SUMO. 
More cities and more details to follow. 
## Los Angeles
### Simulation - speed index

Note the demand is overestimated in the following simulations. To be fixed in future versions.

## Rio de Janeiro

### Congestion Clusters
